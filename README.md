# CS330 Project Learning to Augment

Implementation of CS330 Project Learning to Augment. This codebase is forked from https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100, and our implementation is built on top of the original codebase.

## Requirements

This is my experiment eviroument
- python3.6
- pytorch1.6.0+cu101
- tensorboard 2.2.2(optional)


## Usage

### 1. enter directory
```bash
$ cd pytorch-cifar100
```

### 2. dataset
I will use cifar100 dataset from torchvision since it's more convenient, but I also
kept the sample code for writing your own dataset module in dataset folder, as an
example for people don't know how to write it.

### 3. run tensorbard(optional)
Install tensorboard
```bash
$ pip install tensorboard
$ mkdir runs
Run tensorboard
$ tensorboard --logdir='runs' --port=6006 --host='localhost'
```

### 4. train the model
You need to specify the net you want to train using arg -net

```bash
# use gpu to train preactresnet18 classification model without learning augmentation module
$ python train.py -net preactresnet18 -gpu -lr 0.1 -augmentation_lr 0.01

# use gpu to train preactresnet18 classification model and learning the aumgentation model that outputs a single value E2E
$ python train.py -net preactresnet18 -gpu -learning_augmentation -augmentation_mode value -lr 0.1 -augmentation_lr 0.01

# use gpu to train preactresnet18 classification model and learning the aumgentation model that outputs a distribution E2E
$ python train.py -net preactresnet18 -gpu -learning_augmentation -augmentation_mode distribution -lr 0.1 -augmentation_lr 0.01

# use gpu to train preactresnet18 classification model and learning the aumgentation model that outputs a single value using 2-step training strategy
$ python train.py -net preactresnet18 -gpu -learning_augmentation -augmentation_mode value -two_step -lr 0.1 -augmentation_lr 0.01 -lr_ratio 1.0

# use gpu to train preactresnet18 classification model and learning the aumgentation model that outputs a distribution using 2-step training strategy
$ python train.py -net preactresnet18 -gpu -learning_augmentation -augmentation_mode distribution -two_step -lr 0.1 -augmentation_lr 0.01 -lr_ratio 1.0
```

sometimes, you might want to use warmup training by set ```-warm``` to 1 or 2, to prevent network
diverge during early training phase.
Also you can adjust augmentation model learning rate seperately using ```-augmentation_lr```.
And in 2-step training paradigm, you can use ```-lr_ratio``` to adjust the inner learning rate used in step 1 repsect to the outter learning rate used in step 2.

The supported net args are:
```
squeezenet

```
Normally, the weights file with the best accuracy would be written to the disk with name suffix 'best'(default in checkpoint folder).


### 5. test the model
Test the model using test.py
```bash
$ python test.py -net vgg16 -weights path_to_vgg16_weights_file
```

## Training Details
I didn't use any training tricks to improve accuray, if you want to learn more about training tricks,
please refer to my another [repo](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/Bag_of_Tricks_for_Image_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks), contains
various common training tricks and their pytorch implementations.


I follow the hyperparameter settings in paper [Improved Regularization of Convolutional Neural Networks with Cutout](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552v2), which is init lr = 0.1 divide by 5 at 60th, 120th, 160th epochs, train for 200
epochs with batchsize 128 and weight decay 5e-4, Nesterov momentum of 0.9. You could also use the hyperparameters from paper [Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06548v1) and [Random Erasing Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896v2), which is initial lr = 0.1, lr divied by 10 at 150th and 225th epochs, and training for 300 epochs with batchsize 128, this is more commonly used. You could decrese the batchsize to 64 or whatever suits you, if you dont have enough gpu memory.

You can choose whether to use TensorBoard to visualize your training procedure
